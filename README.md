# LAMARR NLP Workshop:
## Recent Trends in Large Language Models: Applications, Methodologies, and Future Directions

**Date:** March 13th, 2024
**Time:** 10:30 AM â€“ 03:30 PM
**Location:** Friedrich-Hirzebruch-Allee 6, Room 0.107

**Description:**
This tutorial will discuss recent popular small and large language models (LLMs) and impart a practical understanding of how these state-of-the-art LLMs can be utilized across various NLP tasks. Specifically, we cover three interesting research directions: Interpretability of LLMs, Robustness of LLMs, and Bridging language on machines vs. language in the brain. Also, we focus on reviewing recent methodologies such as efficient prompting, in-context learning, instruction-tuning, and RAG, and demonstrate how these techniques can be integrated into various real-world applications.

**Presenters:**
